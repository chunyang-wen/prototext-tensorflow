Tensorflow has a tool called `prototext`.

It is bundled with Tensorflow so tightly. This repo extracts essential code.

### Install google protobuf

You have to install protobuf and then change the locations in CMakeLists.txt

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/protobuf
# cd to protobuf directory
mkdir output
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix={path-to-output}
make && make install
```

### Modify CMakeLists.txt

```CMake
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES({path-to-output}/include)
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES({path-to-output}/lib)
```

### Execute command

```bash
mkdir build
cd build && cmake ..
# generate a binary called `proto_text` with path={path-to-proto-text}
```

### Generate tensorflow pb_text

Write a bash script, such as `pb.sh` with following content:

```bash
# cd to the home to tensorflow

function bbbb() {
    cmd="{path-to-proto-text}" # generated by previous process
    file=$1
    # to remove ./
    file=${file:2}
    ${cmd} ${file}
}

export -f bbbb

find . -name "*.proto" -exec bash -c 'bbbb "$0"' {} \;
```
