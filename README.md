Tensorflow has a tool called `prototext`.

It is bundled with Tensorflow so tightly. This repo extracts essential code.

mkdir build
cd build && cmake ..
```

### Generate tensorflow pb_text

```
# cd to the home to tensorflow

function bbbb() {
    cmd="path/to/prototext" # generated by previous process
    file=$1
    file=${file:2}
    ${cmd} ${file}
}

export -f bbbb

find . -name "*.proto" -exec bash -c 'bbbb "$0"' {} \;
